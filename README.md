# Belgian-azerty macbook keyboard layout file for external Windows keyboards
Mac keylayout file for external Windows keyboard with Belgian azerty layout.\

I created it for my own personal need to have a proper Belgian azerty keyboard layout on a Macbook that match with the labels on a usb connected Corsair K70 mechanical keyboard with Belgian Windows azerty layout.

It will match most of the external Windows keyboards with Belgian azerty layout though.
- Windows key acts as Command Key
- AltGr key acts as Option key
